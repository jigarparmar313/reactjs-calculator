# Simple Calculator using ReactJS

## Overview

This project is a simple calculator built using ReactJS. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface consists of a display and a button panel for interaction.

## Features

- Clear (`C`) button to reset the input.
- Arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Equal (`=`) button to compute the result.
- Support for numeric input and decimal points.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main components:

1. **`App.js`**: The main component that manages the state and renders the heading, display, and button container.
2. **`BtnsContainer.js`**: Contains the buttons for the calculator.
3. **`Display.js`**: Displays the current input or result.
4. **`Heading.js`**: Displays the heading of the application.

   cd simple-react-calculator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

1. **Start the Vite development server:**

   ```bash

   ```

## Usage

1. **Entering Numbers:**
   Click on the numeric buttons (`0-9`) to enter numbers.

2. **Performing Operations:**
   Click on the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform arithmetic operations.

3. **Clearing Input:**
   Click on the `C` button to clear the input.

4. **Calculating Result:**
   Click on the `=` button to display the result of the entered expression.

## Styling

The styles for the components are defined in CSS modules:
